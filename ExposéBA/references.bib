	abstract = {Modular process plants are a promising approach to accelerate the engineering of greenfield process plants. This is achieved by the combination of pre-engineered process equipment assemblies ({PEAs}) with a standardized interface for the integration in process control systems, the module type package ({MTP}). This standardized interface can be integrated in the engineering process to further improve the potential. In this paper existing standards are used to generate aspects of the {MTP}. For this purpose, the engineering process of conventional plants is adapted for the engineering of {PEAs}. Therefore, similarities and potential of the described aspects have been analyzed regarding shared fundamental standards and characterized by their location in the asset life cycle. To describe the interconnections of the different standards, exemplary rules are proposed, which can be used for a transformation.},

	abstract = {The hazard and operability ({HAZOP}) method is widely used in chemical and process industries to identify and evaluate hazards. Due to its human-centered nature, it is time-consuming, and the results depend on the team composition. In addition, the factors time pressure, type of implementation, experience of the participants, and participant involvement affect the results. This research aims to digitize the {HAZOP} method. The investigation shows that knowledge-based systems with ontologies for knowledge representation are suitable to achieve the objective. Complex interdisciplinary knowledge regarding facility, process, substance, and site information must be represented to perform the task. A result of this work is a plant part taxonomy and a developed object-oriented equipment entity library. During ontology development, typical {HAZOP} scenarios, as well as their structure, components, and underlying causal model, were investigated. Based on these observations, semantic relationships between the scenario components were identified. The likelihood of causes and severity of consequences were determined as part of an automatic risk assessment using a risk matrix to determine safeguards reliably. An inference algorithm based on semantic reasoners and case-based reasoning was developed to exploit the ontology and evaluate the input data object containing the plant representation. With consideration given to topology, aspects like the propagation of sub-scenarios through plant parts were considered. The results of the developed knowledge-based system were automatically generated {HAZOP} worksheets. Evaluation of the achieved results was based on representative case studies in which the relevance, comprehensibility, and completeness of the automatically identified scenarios were considered. The achieved results were compared with conventionally prepared {HAZOP} tables for benchmark purposes. By paying particular attention to the causal relationships between scenario components, the risk assessment, and with consideration of safeguards, the quality of the automatically generated results was comparable to conventional {HAZOP} worksheets. This research shows that formal ontologies are suitable for representing complex interdisciplinary knowledge in the field of process and plant safety. The results contribute to the use of knowledge-based systems for digitizing the {HAZOP} method. When used correctly, knowledge-based systems can help decrease the preparation time and repetitious nature of {HAZOP} studies and standardize results.},
